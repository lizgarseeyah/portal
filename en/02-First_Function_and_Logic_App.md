# Create your first serverless function & workflow

## Background

In this challenge you will start creating your first serverless
functions and workflows, which are key skills for the upcoming
challenges which make up this OpenHack.

## Challenge

Your first goal is for each team member to create and debug an HTTP
triggered Azure Function locally on your own development machine. This
function has the following requirements:

* **Verb**: GET
* **Input parameters**: A `productId` value is passed to it as a
query parameter or an HTTP route
* **Result**: "The product name for your product id
{the id passed in to the function} is Starfruit Explosion"

The second goal is for each team member to create their own Azure Resource
Group in your team's Azure Subscription, and then deploy the function from
the first goal to it.
**Make sure to use different, unique Function App names!** Then test the
function after deployed.

Your final goal for this challenge is for each team member to create an
HTTP triggered Logic App in their Resource Group. The Logic App has the
following trigger requirements:

* **Verb**: POST
* **Input payload example**:

    ```JSON
    {
        "productId": "75542e38-563f-436f-adeb-f426f1dabb5c"
    }
    ```

Next, you should configure the Logic App to call the Azure Function created
 earlier, passing the `productId` into it, then reply successfully with the
 response text content of **"{response from function} and the description
 is This starfruit ice cream is out of this world!"**.

So, for the example inputs above the Logic App would reply with
**"The product name for your product id 75542e38-563f-436f-adeb-f426f1dabb5c
is Starfruit Explosion and the description is This starfruit ice cream is
out of this world!"**.

**Hint**: To pass query parameters from Logic Apps to a function in the Azure
Functions action, you can write the name and values as JSON in the Queries
field. Example:

```JSON
{
  "queryParamName": "queryparamValue"
}
```

## Success Criteria

*Given the complexity and variety of potential solutions, the goals for all
challenge are verified by your team's coach.*

* Everyone on your team must demonstrate that you created an HTTP triggered
Azure Function locally that accepts a GET verb. Show to your coach that you
can call that function and receive a successful response with the right text
provided and the value of `productId` properly filled in.

* Everyone on your team must demonstrate that you deployed that HTTP triggered
Azure Function to Azure. Show to your coach that you can call that deployed
function and receive a successful response.

* Everyone on your team must demonstrate that you can call the Logic App via HTTP
POST which then calls the Function, and that it replies successfully with the
correct extended text.

* Infrastructure Bonus: If your team has a member working on IaC, demonstrate the ability to deploy an Azure Function and Logic App services with code, instead of performing the tasks related to the other success critera.

## Bonus - Infrastructure as Code

It's important for all teams to be able to deploy and experiment with new technologies to help determine how they can be used, but at some point they must be operationalized.  While the application developers are learning to work with Azure Functions and Logic Apps, develop code that can deploy those services in a repeatable manner using a consistant naming pattern. Consider common domain specific languages for infrastructure deployments and work with your team so they can be prepared to use these components for challenges going forward.
